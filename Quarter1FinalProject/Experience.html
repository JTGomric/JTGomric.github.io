          <p>This is a picture of me holding the foil that the other counselors and I used to cook foilburgers out at Vegas Vista, one of our camping spots. We spent most of the day building the fire, using the large cedar trees from the surrounding area to build the main structure of it. The entire area doesn't have much grass and is instead covered in a layer of various mosses because of the rocky terrain underneath. This rocky terrain also makes it difficult for plants to grow, which means that cacti can naturally begin to grow on the rocks, which is quite unusual for southern Illinois.</p>

          <p>This is a picture of the closing campfire we built for the last week of the summer. It was probably about 15 feet tall and could probably comfortably fit at least four or five people inside it before it was lit.
             It was so hot that we had to alter our seating arrangements in order to keep an adequate distance between us and the fire. If you look closely, you will see someone spraying the fire with a gardening hose to try and coax it into falling away from the crowd.</p>

          <p>This is a picture of Lake Echon that I took while walking across the road that was used to dam it up and to create Lake St. Isaac behind it. Lake Echon acts as the boating lake, while Lake St. Isaac serves as the swimming lake and has its own artificial beach.</p>
