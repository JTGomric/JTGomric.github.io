          <p>I have been visting the Shawnee National Forest every year since I was around nine years old and have been enjoying it ever since. Within the forest, there are numerous opportunities to go camping or hiking or to do a variety of other activity in nature. The image to the right is a picture of the magnificent Pakentuck, the tallest waterfall in the midwest. It is sights like this that make the Shawnee National Forest so beautiful and worth everyone's consideration and time.</p>
