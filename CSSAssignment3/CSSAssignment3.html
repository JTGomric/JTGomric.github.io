    <p>I would like to visit these places because I believe that they can all provide unique experiences that I have not had the chance to see before. Seeing the immensity of the mountains in Colorado and Oregon with the snow and ice at the peak would be a truly breathtaking experience. I would also love to visit their for the potential of skiing on these massive mountains. Going to the Grand Canyon would be a totally different but equally moving experience. Seeing how the river in the bottom of the canyon has shaped it into what it is today would be very informative about the way that natural processes can shape the earth. Looking down over the edge of the canyon would also be frightening at first but would eventually be a very cool experience. Visiting the various cities on my list would also be a completely new experience for me, as some of them are truly massive and complex. I would say that London is probably highest on my list of cities just because I have never been to Europe and I would love to experience all of the things that are different overseas. New York and Hong Kong would also be interesting but I would enjoy Europe more. All of these places are equally interesting and I would love to visit them.
